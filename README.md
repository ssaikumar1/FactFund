# 🌱 FactFund

**FactFund** is a decentralized Web3 crowdfunding platform built on the [Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)]. It promotes transparent, secure, and accountable fundraising by enabling creators to launch campaigns with built-in anti-spam measures, fund tracking, and proof-of-completion mechanisms.

## 🌐 Project Overview

FactFund solves key trust and transparency issues in traditional crowdfunding by leveraging blockchain-based features:

- Secured Authentication
- Proposals require token-locking to prevent spam
- Each campaign uses a unique sub-account to manage donations
- Donors can verify outcomes through submitted proof-of-completion materials
- Funds are disbursed only after targets are met, and platform fees are automatically applied

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Reduce spam via token-locking before campaign creation  
- Maintain transparency with campaign-specific fund sub-accounts  
- Release funds only after meeting fundraising goals  
- Promote accountability with post-campaign proof submission  
- Return locked tokens upon campaign completion  
- Automate 2% platform fee collection
